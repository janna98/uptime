# Cosmosodyssey project for Uptime

Can be found at: https://secure-depths-39127.herokuapp.com/

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Two users have already been added to log in with: email "lisa@simpson.com" and password "parool", and email "bart@simpson.com" and password "parool"

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

If API fetching is unsuccessful, it might be a good idea to remove comments from database seeds in /priv/repo/seeds.exs and run `mix ecto.reset`
